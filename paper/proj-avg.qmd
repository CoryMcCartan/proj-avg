title: Projective Averages for Summarizing Redistricting Ensembles
abstract: |
  A recurring challenge in the application of redistricting simulation 
  algorithms lies in extracting useful summaries and comparisons from a large
  ensemble districting plans, each of which is a complex discrete object.
  Researchers often compute summary statistics for each district in a plan, and
  then study the distribution of these summary statistics across plans in the
  ensemble. This approach discards rich geographic information that is inherent
  in districting plans. We introduce the projective average, an operation that
  projects a district-level summary statistic back to the underlying geography
  and then averages this statistic across plans in the ensemble. For example,
  the projective average of districts' Democratic vote share would calculate the 
  average Democratic vote share of the simulated district to which each precinct 
  belongs. Compared to traditional district-level summaries,
  projective averages are a powerful tool for geographically granular, 
  sub-district analysis of districting plans along a variety of dimensions.
  However, care must be taken to properly account for variation within 
  redistricting ensembles, to avoid misleading conclusions.

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Redistricting simulation algorithms are widely used in both academic research on redistricting and in litigation over districting plans in the United States [see recently @deluca2023validating; @imai2023sc].
Modern simulation algorithms are able to generate a large sample, or *ensemble*, of districting plans from a specific target distribution that incorporates real-world constraints on legislative districts [@recom; @mccartan2023; @autry2023metropolized; @cannon2022spanning].

Redistricting ensembles are commonly compared against a specific plan of interest (usually, the plan enacted by a legislature) in order to probe for factors that affected the drawing of that plan.
This comparison is done on the basis of a number of district-level summary statistics.
For instance, the Democratic vote share or the geographic compactness of each district in the enacted plan might be compared to the corresponding measures for the ensemble.
If the statistics for the enacted plan are outliers in the distribution of the statistic from the ensemble, that can be evidence of intentional manipulation of the enacted plan away from the baseline represented by the ensemble.

While analyses based on district-level statistics have been powerfully applied to identify gerrymanders, the district-level approach leaves something to be desired for the granular study of districting plans.
Redistricting is an intrinsically geographic endeavor, yet geography makes no appearance in the district-level analysis: once the plans have been simulated, we switch our focus to properties of abstractly numbered districts.
This is evident in the visualizations produced by district-level analyses, which are dominated by histograms and boxplots, not maps.
District-level analyses are also fundamentally coarse---if there are, say, four districts, then all the information contained in a districting plan is boiled down to four numbers.
It's impossible to use a district-level analysis to conclude anything about the properties of a districting plan at much more local scales.

This paper introduces the *projective average* as a universal operation for putting the geography back into district-level analyses.
The projective average operates on the fundamental building blocks of districting plans: precincts, or in some states, counties.
Informally, the projective average takes a district-level summary statistic and projects it back to the precinct level, producing a map, rather than a histogram or boxplot, that visualizes the summary statistic for the simulation ensemble.
It achieves this by calculating the average value of that summary statistic in the various districts to which the precinct belongs across the ensemble.
@sec-formal formalizes this operation and demonstrates how projective averages can be used to make comparisons between an ensemble and a specific plan of interest.

Analyses using ideas similar to the projective average have appeared in past work.
Comparing a projective average to a particular plan (what we term a *projective contrast*) recalls the notion of *partisan dislocation* of @deford2022partisan, where the partisan lean of a precinct's district is compared to an average over a number of nearby precincts But projective averages are built on top of simulation ensembles, while partisan dislocation is not.
Moreover, partisan dislocation applies only to partisan vote shares, while projective averages may be applied to any summary statistic, such as compactness or racial composition.
Despite these differences, other authors have referred to projective contrast maps as "dislocation maps" [@imai2023sc].

These studies and other similar work have all ignored the fundamental variation in precinct-projected summary statistics across plans in the ensemble.
As explained in @sec-var, this variation, and not just the ensemble-wide average, must be incorporated into analyses to properly contextualize numerical results and avoid misleading conclusions.
We provide concrete recommendations for visualizing projective averages to account for variation.
@sec-concl concludes.

# Formalizing Projective Averages {#sec-formal}

We motivate and demonstrate the use of projective averages in a real-world context through a running example in the state of Oregon.
Between the 2010 and 2020 redistricting cycles, Oregon Democrats gained unified control of state government.
In 2021 the state adopted new congressional districts on a party-line vote that some viewed as a partisan gerrymander, though legal efforts to challenge the new map on these grounds were unsuccessful [@opbcase].

Simulation algorithms can be used to study the extent of partisan gerrymandering in Oregon's 2021 districts by generating an ensemble of partisan-neutral districting plans.
In general, districting plans are constructed out of precincts, counties, or other geographic "building blocks." Following the notation of @mccartan2023, we refer to the set of these geographic units (hereinafter "precincts" for simplicity) as $V$.
A districting plan with $d$ districts is then a mapping $\xi:V \to \{1, 2, \dots, d\}$ from precincts to integer labels.
Districting plans must satisfy a number of criteria, including equal population across districts, connectedness, and geographic compactness.
We denote set of all valid districting plans by $\X$.

A redistricting ensemble is a sample from some (usually known, but possibly unknown) probability distribution $\pi$ on $\X$.
Here, we'll use an ensemble of 5,000 plans generated by @mccartan2022simulated using the algorithm of @mccartan2023.
The target distribution for this sample prioritizes geographically compact districts among those plans which are contiguous and have all district populations within 0.5% of equality.
Five sampled plans and the enacted districts are shown in @fig-ensemble.

A district-level summary statistic $f:\X\to\R^d$ reports a value for each district in a plan.
Generally $f$ is defined by $f(\xi)_j = g(\xi^{-1}(j))$ for some function $g:2^V\to\R$ that calculates a summary value for any set of precincts.
For example, $g$ might calculate the typical Democratic vote share in a set of precincts.

Letting $\Xi\sim\pi$ be a single randomly sampled plan, $f(\Xi)$ is the distribution of the summary statistic in the $n$ districts.
If $\xi^0$ is the comparison plan of interest, the traditional district-level analysis compares $f(\xi^0)$ to the distribution $f(\Xi)$.
In practice, analysts have access not to the full distribution $\pi$ but a finite ensemble $S=\{\xi_i\}_{i=1}^n$ for some $n$.

The Oregon ensemble's distribution of the order statistics of the normal Democratic vote share are shown in @fig-distr-dshare, with the enacted plan's values marked for comparison.
For most districts, the enacted plan's Democratic vote share lies in the tails of the simulated distribution, with an overall pattern that suggests the packing of Republican voters into one district and the cracking of Democratic voters in the most heavily Democratic district.
However, since @fig-distr-dshare shows only order statistics, we are unable to localize any of these patterns or understand how they arise though particular choices made by the drawers of the enacted plan.

Simulation analysis and the process of producing a projective average and contrast.

## Projective distribution and average

The projective average is designed to tackle these issues.
We define the *projective distribution of* $f$ *at precinct* $v\in V$ as $$
\proj_\pi f(v) \coloneq f(\Xi)_{\Xi(v)} \qor
\proj_S f(v) \coloneq \{ f(\xi_i)_{\xi_i(v)} \}_{i=1}^n
$$ in the population and for finite ensembles, respectively.
In other words, the distribution of $f(\Xi)$ in the (random) district which $v$ belongs to.
When $f$ is defined by a precinct-set summary function $g$, the projective distribution is equivalently defined by $\proj_\pi f = g\circ \Xi^{-1} \circ \Xi$, i.e., $g$ applied to the fiber of $\Xi$ containing $v$.

The *projective average of* $f$ *at precinct* $v$ is then naturally defined as $$
\bar{f}_\pi(v) \coloneq \E[\proj_\pi f(v)] = \E[f(\Xi)_{\Xi(v)}] \qand
\bar{f}_S(v) \coloneq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n f(\xi_i)_{\xi_i(v)}.
$$ Thus while the district-level distribution of $f$ is supported on $\R^n$, the projective distribution $\proj_\pi f$ is supported on $\R^{|V|}$, and the projective average $\bar f$ assigns each precinct a single value, allowing it to be plotted on a map.

@fig-proj-stacked shows a sample of four elements from the projective distribution of normal Democratic vote share, and @fig-proj-avg plots the projective average, which is the result of averaging across the maps in @fig-proj-stacked and the 4,996 others in the ensemble.
Unsurprisingly, the areas in and around Portland in the northwest of the state typically belong to heavily Democratic districts, while the southern Willamette Valley typically belongs to a swing district, and the rural south and east of the state belongs to a safely Republican district, on average.

## Projective contrasts

The same projection operation applied to an ensemble to yield the projective distribution and average can be applied to a single redistricting plan.
Here, the operation simply maps each precinct to the value of the summary statistic in its corresponding district.
Thus $\proj_{\{\xi^0\}} f$ can be identified with $\bar{f}_{\{\xi^0\}}$ , each of which can take on at most $d$ values.

A traditional district-level analysis compares $f(\xi^0)$ with $f(S)$.
The analogue with projective averages is the *projective contrast*, defined as $\bar{f}_{\{\xi^0\}} - \bar{f}_S$.
Intuitively, the projective contrast reports how much higher or lower $f$ is in the enacted plan than the average simulated plan.
For example, if $f$ measures districts' compactness (higher values indicating more compactness), then $\bar{f}_{\{\xi^0\}} - \bar{f}_S$ would be positive in regions of the state that belong to more compact districts under the enacted plan than under the typical plan from the ensemble.

@fig-proj-contr plots the projective contrast of normal Democratic vote share.
Blue areas have positive values of the contrast and correspond to precincts belonging to a more Democratic district in the enacted plan than the average simulated plan.
While small on the statewide map, the city of Portland is red, indicating it is assigned to a less Democratic district under the enacted map, while the areas surrounding Portland and extending down the coast are blue.
Meanwhile, the south and east of the state are more Republican than would otherwise be expected.
This overall pattern is consistent with the "crack heavily Democratic areas, pack Republican areas" pattern observed in the order statistic boxplots, but the projective contrast map allows us to confirm the pattern and see exactly where the packing and cracking are taking place.

## Aggregating projective averages and contrasts

Projective averages and contrasts can also be re-aggregated to larger geographies as a way of further summarizing the very granular results of projective averaging.
Aggregation is accomplished by taking a population or voting-population weighted average of the projective average or contrast across precincts.
Formally, given a function $q:V\to\N$ that labels regions of the map, we can define an *aggregated projective average* as $$
\bar{F}^q_S(j) \coloneq \frac{\sum_{v\in q^{-1}(j)} w_v \bar{f}_S(v)}{\sum_{v\in q^{-1}(j)} w_v}
$$ for each $j$ in the range of $q$ and for some inverse-population weights $\{w_v\}_{v\in V}$.
Analogous definitions are naturally made for population projective averages $\bar{f}_\pi$ and for projective contrasts such as $\bar{f}_{\{\xi^0\}} - \bar{f}_S$.

@kenny2023widespread (Figure 2) take projective contrasts of the Democratic win probability and then aggregate these contrasts up to the congressional district level to form a national accouting of partisan effects in each district.
The use of aggregated projective contrasts means that effects can be well-defined and calculated for each enacted district, even though the underlying simulation ensembles involve tens of thousands of completely different, non-overlapping districts.

# Accounting for Variation Across the Ensemble {#sec-var}

Calculating a projective average requires compressing the entire projective distribution over each precinct to a single number: its mean.
One side effect of this averaging step is to lose information about how unusual a particular value for the projective average in a precinct is. For instance, a plan that is more or less Democratic than the average simulated plan may not be a partisan gerrymander or even an outlier in the projective distriution.
Informally, we would actually *expect the typical map to be atypical* in some areas of the state.

![Projective contrasts of seven randomly sampled districting plans and the enacted plan versus the simulated ensemble.](figures/contr_samp.pdf){#fig-contr-samp}

@fig-contr-samp illustrates the problem.
The projective contrast of Democratic vote share has been calculated, not just for the enacted plan, but for seven draws from the ensemble as well.
We invite the reader to guess which of the eight plans is in fact the enacted.\footnote{\rotatebox[origin=c]{180}{The enacted plan is in the upper right corner.}}
The difficulty of this task illustrates that the enacted plan may not be an outlier along the dimensions plotted by the projective contrast.
Put differently, without accounting for the expected variation in projective averages and contrasts across the ensemble, analysts may be misled in their interpretations.


## Graphical approaches

One simple, if not particularly formalized, way to address this problem is by using something exactly like @fig-contr-samp, where the 'true' projective contrast or average is displayed among a number of 'null' averages that provide appropriate comparative context.
Indeed, following the "lineup procedure" of @buja2009statistical, analysts may benefit from initially randomizing the location of the true contrast and attempting to identify it as a visual outlier.

A complementary approach is to normalize the projective contrast precinct-wise by the standard deviation of the projective distribution at each precinct.
This has the effect of generating precinct-level z-scores for the contrast of interest.
Areas with relatively high variation in the projective distribution will stand out less than before normalization.
A side-by-side example of this approach is illustrated in **FIGURE**.

## A signal localization and multiple testing approach

For researchers desiring a more formal way of testing when a projective contrast indicates deviations beyond what would be expected for a random sample from the target distribution, we borrow methodology from the multiple comparisons and signal localization literature.

# Conclusion {#sec-concl}

As we have stressed, projective averages are useful far beyond studies of partisan gerrymandering, and can be applied to any district-level summary, including compactness scores or win probabilities.
More complex extensions are possible too.
@mccartan2022individual develop a framework of individual harm in redistricting.
Harm is calculated along the lines of a projective contrast of win probabilities and measures the probability that a typical voter is "mis-represented" in their district to their detriment.
